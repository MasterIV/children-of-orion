To assemble ships we use ship generation points (SGP).
Normally the group should receive 20 points per player.
For additional points the players can negotiate with
the GM to take a credit and start the game with some debt.
This can be a good motivation for players to actually 
do missions and earn money.

Every ship comes by default with the most basic systems:
 * Cockpit / Bridge
 * Life support
 * Drive
 * Fuel tanks

These have not to much game play relevance at this point so we just assume the ship has them.
We might only deal with them in special situations and then it is up to the GM.
