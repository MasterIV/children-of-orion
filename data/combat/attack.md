To attack the actor makes a combat check for the weapon he uses.
The ticks spend on the action depend on the speed of the weapon used.
The base difficulty of an attack is 15.
Bonus and penalties might apply depending on the circumstances of the attach.
These could be for example:

**Visibility** 
* Twilight: -2
* Darkness: -4
* Absolute darkness: -8

**Ranged combat:**
* Partial cover: -2
* Full cover: -4
* Shooting into close combat: -2
* Attacker in close combat: -4
* Size fo the target: -5 to +5
* Moving target: -1

**Distance**
* Close: -2
* Medium: 0
* Far: -2
* Extreme: -4

These add to any wound or condition penalties.
These influences don't change the difficulty but modify the result of the attachers check.

**Defending:** The targeted character can diced to defend in case of an successful attack.
In order to do so he makes a check on the defense skill.
The attack is avoided if the result higher than the attackers skill result.
The ticks for the defense have to be spend regardless if the defense was successful or not.

**Defense modifiers:**
* Dodging: -3
* Blocking ranged attacks: -2
* Sitting or kneeing: -3
* Prone: -6

**Avoiding area damage:** It is not possible to directly defend against attacks that do area damage.
Instead the defender might make a defense check with difficulty 15.
Each quality level resulting from his check increase the armor by one against this attack.

**Quality levels:** When the attach is still successful quality levels are determined by taking
the difference of the attackers and the defenders checks.
If the target did not defend the base difficulty is taken to determine
the quality levels. Each quality level increases the damage by one.
