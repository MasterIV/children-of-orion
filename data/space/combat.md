Space combat works basically as normal combat, 
except that the possible actions may be very different.
Initiative is determined as normal.

The crew members still use their individual skills and attributes to make checks.
Health, armor and other values will be determined by the ship 
(as lon as an attack is not explicitly targeting the crew).
There are several roles that you usually find on a ship:

 * Pilot
 * Gunner
 * Engineer
 * Commander
 * Bridge Crew / Since officer
 
A ship has the following main values:

 * Structure: equivalent of player life points
 * System: equivalent to mental health pool
 * Shield: works like an additional buffer of easily recoverable life points
 * Armor: which works the same way as character armor but is only applied for damage penetrating the shield

There is no difference between immediate and continues any more
since a space ship is not able to do attacks of opportunity.
The actions are the following:

| Action | Duration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fire Weapon | Depending on weapon | Attack another a target in range |
| Aim | 2-6 | The actor receives a bonus of one per two ticks of aiming on his next attack. maximum bonus: 3 |
| Patch critical damage | 15 | Make a engineering check difficulty 15 + 5 times (unpatched) critical damage on the system you try to repair. If successful that damage counts as patched until the system receives another damage and the penalties don't apply any more. |
| Stabilize system | 10 | Make a computers check difficulty 15 to repair one + quality level system damage |
