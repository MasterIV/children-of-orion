Shields can protect a ship from possible damage.
It works like an easily refillable lifepoint buffer.
Therefor they require enormous amounts of energy.
Capacitors are used to power the shields since the reactor output is normally not enough to power them.
For this reason shields can not be kept active all the time.
The capacitors need time to recharge if a shield looses strength or collapses completely.

The shields need constant energy supply even with the capacitors.
The energy is required to control the system and recharge the capacitors.
If the control module of the shield is not powered it will shut down the force field.
The capacitors will remain in their current status.

The regeneration rate determines how many ticks it needs to restore one shield point.
Regeneration immediately starts after the shield lost maximum capacity.
