Space ship weapons almost work like other weapons.
They come in a base version and can be adjusted to the needs of their owner.
The damage is against other space ships.
If a ship weapons hits a person, the damage is multiplied with 4.
The other way around, personal weapons only do a quarter of their damage to ships.
