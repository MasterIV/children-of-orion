To detirmene damage, roll a number of d6 equal to the damage rating 
including additional quality level. Every one and two in the result
are added up as direct damage points. Any threes and fours do nothing.
Fives and sixes cound as effects. These effects can be used to trigger
some special qualities of a weapon or can simply be counted as an 
additional damage point. Every effect can only be used in one way.
The actor can decide how to spend his effects.

Applying the armor works similar. The defender rolls a number of d6
equal to his armor raiting. The result of this roll is handled the 
same way the damage is determined. 
The remaining damage is then subtracted from the targets health.
Of course negative damage is not possible.

Each player has the following life pools:

* **Physical Damage:** ( Con + 3 ) * 5
* **Mental Damage:** ( Wil + 3 ) * 5

These are noted in bars of ten points. 
For each completely lost bar the character suffers a penalty of one on all cecks.
Each time a player is exceeding one of this bars and goes
into the next one he has to make a toughness with difficulty 15 check.
All penalties apply on this check. If the check fails he gets the first
condition of the following list. If he already suffers from that condition
he receives the next one in the list instead.

* Desoriented
* Shock
* Uncontious
* Coma

**Mental Demage:** Non leathal weapons like tasers or unarmed attacks 
might do mental damage instead of physical damage. The only difference
is that they are faster to regenerate and their loss can not directly 
kill a character. But every point that exceeds the threshhold of
mental damage is converted into physical damage.

**Interrutions:** A character has to make a self-control check when
receiving damage while performing a contious action in order to
not be interrupted. The difficulty is 15 plus the amound of damage inflicted.

### Offensive Effects

* **Deadly:** The effect can be used to inclict two damage
* **Piercing:** Reduces the targets armor by one
* **Stunning:** The target looses a tick
* **Erritating:** The target suffers a penalty of one on its next check 
* **Explosive:** Increase the area of effect by one 
* **Interrupting:** Increase the difficulty of checks to resist interruption by 3 

### Defensive Effects

* **Reflecting:** Absorb two damage from beam weapons
* **Ballistisch:** Absorb two damage from projectile or archaic weapons
* **Gepolstert:** Absorb two close combat damage
* **Hard:** Convert two damage into stun damage
* **Retalliate:** Grants a bonus of one to the next action

### Conditions

* **Desoriented:** the character needs 5 ticks to get orientation again. 
As long as he is suffering this condition he can only perform reactions or try to recover from the condition.
