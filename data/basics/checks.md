To perform a skill check, roll 2d10 and add your skill value to the result.
The check is successful if the result is higher or equal to the check difficulty.
It is also possible to do a comparing skill check. 
In this case the actor with the higher results wins.
If it is drawn, the defender wins.

**Examples for check difficulty:**
* Easy: 15
* Normal: 20
* Challenging: 25
* Difficult: 30
* Hard: 35
* Impossible: 40

**Quality levels:** Each three points of the result above the difficulty counts as a quality level.
These can improve the result of a check.

**Botch:** If the dice are showing a 3 or less the 
check was a critical failure and bad things may happen.

**Triumph:** If the dice show 19 or above it is a triumph.
The result is increased by additional 6 points.
Additional the GM might define positive side effects.

### Progressive checks

In some cases a task might require more than one check.
In this case the GM defines a number of required quality 
levels additional to the difficulty.
The character can then make multiple checks to collect these.
If a check is a botch, all progress is lost.
Depending on the task, negative quality levels can also have
side effects (like increased material cost because some materials were wasted).

A special form of this is a group check where multiple participants 
can contribute to the progress of the task. 

### Cooperation

If a task can benefit from assistance, it is possible to do so.
The assisting character can make the check with the difficulty
reduced by 5 points. Any quality levels achieved count as 
bonus for the main actor in the check. The GM decides how
many people can assist in a check.
