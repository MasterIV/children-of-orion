Skills reflect the characters ability to perform certain tasks.

* **Minimum skill points:** 0
* **Natural skill point maximum:** 12

No points in a skill would mean that the character has rarely or 
never performed this type of task and will most likely not achieve good results.
Real mastery would mean 12 **skill points**. There are only few who have 
perfected their abilities that far.

Every skill has two attributes assigned.
The average of the two attribute values will be the **attribute base** for the skill check.
The sum of attribute base and skill points is then the actual **skill value**.

Summary:
* **Skill points:** Number of skill points that a character has earned in the skill.
* **Attribute base:** Average of the two attributes associate with the skill.
* **Skill value:** Sum of attribute base and skill points.

### Specializations

Every skill has certain suggested applications.
A character can acquire these application as specialization in a skill.
With the specialization the character adds another skill point 
when performing that specific application.
Each skill can only have two specializations and 
each specialization can only be learned once.
Learning a new specialization while already having two specializations for that skill 
will replace one of the existing specializations.
