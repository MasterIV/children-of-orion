In combat we use a timeline. The units on the timeline will be called ticks.

**Step 1 - Initiative:** Every actor rolls a d6 and subtracts it 
from his initiative value. If a player character and npc have the same
value, the player goes first. For two npcs have the same value,
the game master decides. For players, they can agree on an order,
decide based on the reaction attribute or simply roll a die/ flip a coin.

**Step 2 - Determine actor:** The actor on the lowest number will act first.
Are multiple actors on the same tick then the person who entered
the field first acts first. To mark this it is recommended to
always add an actor from the inner side of the timeline so that
the most outer people act first. If it is the first turn after
the initiative, the rules above apply.

**Step 3 - Taking action:** If it is a persons turn, they can either
act immediately or delay their action. there are two options for delaying
an action:

* *Wait:* The actor simply waits. At any time he can decide to
stop waiting and re-enter battle. He will then be placed at the
end of the current tick. Which means all actors in the current
tick will act before the person that returned from waiting.
A variation of this is to just be moved a number of ticks
forward without taking an action.

* *Get ready:* The actor defines a condition that he want's to act on.
As soon as the condition is fulfilled the actor might act immediately,
even before the person that triggered the condition.
If the condition is not triggered the actor might return to
the timeline using the same rules as a waiting character.
