Space combat works basically as normal combat, 
except that the possible actions may be very different.
Initiative is determined as normal.

The crew members still use their individual skills and attributes to make checks.
Health, armor and other values will be determined by the ship 
(as lon as an attack is not explicitly targeting the crew).
There are several roles that you usually find on a ship:

 * Pilot
 * Gunner
 * Engineer
 * Commander
 * Bridge Crew / Since officer
 
A ship has the following main values:

 * Structure: equivalent of player life points
 * System: equivalent to mental health pool
 * Shield: works like an additional buffer of easily recoverable life points
 * Armor: which works the same way as character armor but is only applied for damage penetrating the shield

There is no difference between immediate and continues any more
since a space ship is not able to do attacks of opportunity.
The actions are the following:

| Action | Duration | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fire Weapon | Depending on weapon | Attack another a target in range |
| Aim | 2-6 | The actor receives a bonus of one per two ticks of aiming on his next attack. maximum bonus: 3 |
| Patch critical damage | 15 | Make a engineering check difficulty 15 + 5 times (unpatched) critical damage on the system you try to repair. If successful that damage counts as patched until the system receives another damage and the penalties don't apply any more. |
| Stabilize system | 10 | Make a computers check difficulty 15 to repair one + quality level system damage |
| Perform scan | 10 | Use the scanners to gain information. Difficulty depends on the type of information tried to obtain. |
| Switch station | 3+ | If the switching requires a physical movement it takes longer than just switching between applications |
| Redistribute energy | 8 | A successful engineering difficulty 15 check allows you to redistribute 1 + quality level energy points |

**Simplify NPCs:** To make combat a little faster, the GM might decide
to treat a whole enemy ship as just one character which can perform
multiple actions simultaneously. He always takes the longest action 
duration but all actions and reactions need one tick less.
 
Damage and armor works exactly as in close combat except that effects might differ.
Also ships can inflict critical damage if they spend effects equal to the crit
rating and at least one damage penetrates shield and armor.
A ship can not suffer any conditions but its systems can get damaged
which will have different effects on the ship. Roll one d10 to see which
system got hit:

| Result | System | Max | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Shields | 3 | Reduce shield capacity by 1/3 and double recharge time |
| 2 | Engine | 4 | Penalty of 2 to all pilot checks including defenses |
| 3 | Reactor | 4 | Reduce energy output by 1/4 |
| 4 | Computer | 3 | Suffer 8 system damage and penalty of 1 on weapons and sensor checks |
| 5-6 | Weapon | 2 | Penalty of 2 on weapon handling |
| 7 | Sensors | 3 | Penalty of 2sensor checks |
| 8-10 | Secondary system | 1 | Outage of the system until repaired |

In case of a secondary system, determine one randomly. 
When a system reaches is maximum damage it is completely disabled until
patched or repaired. Damage that exceeds the maximum is 
converted to 5 structure damage.

When a ships structure points go to or below 0 it becomes inoperable.
It will not directly explode (that only happens with a critical reactor malfunction)
but might suffer hull breaches and its energy grid will completely collapse
what results in outage of all systems (including life support).

**Botches:** Since it depends on the role of a character botching it is kind of hard to prepare a table for this.
So for now the GM needs to decide in the case of a botch.
